Many workers in the UK are finding it increasingly difficult to save for retirement. This challenge has become more pronounced with the shift from traditional workplace pensions to defined contribution schemes, where employees are now primarily responsible for their own retirement savings. 

Inflation has caused the amount needed for a basic retirement to rise significantly, making it harder to accumulate a sufficient pension pot. Additionally, the flat-rate state pension offers minimal support, especially for those who have earned less over their lifetime. These issues are further compounded by several factors:

- **1116 people in the UK aged 55 and above have no private pension savings.**
- **On average, people hold 11 different jobs over their lifetime, leading to multiple small pension pots.** In 2022 alone, over Â£26 billion was lost because people had trouble tracking, managing, and claiming these smaller pension accounts.
