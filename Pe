Many UK workers struggle to save enough for retirement, and this problem is getting worse. As companies shift from workplace pensions to defined contribution schemes, employees are now responsible for saving for their own retirement. This change means many people are unprepared for the future.

The amount needed for a basic retirement has risen sharply due to inflation, and the flat-rate state pension offers little help, especially for those who haven't earned a lot throughout their lives. The uncertainty surrounding retirement is further amplified by these issues:

- Over 1,000 people in the UK aged 55 and older have no private pension savings at all.
- On average, people change jobs 11 times over their careers, leading to multiple small pension pots. This made it difficult to track, manage, and claim these smaller accounts, resulting in over Â£26 billion lost in 2022 alone.

Understanding and addressing these challenges is crucial for ensuring a secure retirement for all UK workers.
