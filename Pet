### Why Target Date Funds Are a Smart Choice for Your Retirement

#### Backed by Research
Studies show that many people in the UK struggle to save adequately for retirement, and traditional pensions are no longer as widely available. Research has shown that a well-managed investment strategy, like a target date fund, can make a real difference. These funds are built on decades of retirement planning expertise and are designed to help you reach your goals with less stress. With BlackRock's LifePath®, you’re investing in a solution based on years of data and proven results.

#### A "Glidepath" for Your Lifetime
One of the key features of target date funds is what’s called a “glidepath.” This means that your investment mix is carefully adjusted over time to match your stage in life. When you're younger, the fund focuses more on growth by investing in stocks, which tend to have higher potential returns. As you get older and closer to retirement, it automatically shifts to safer investments, like bonds, to protect your savings. This gradual adjustment helps manage risk over your entire lifetime, giving you peace of mind as you get closer to retiring.

#### Age-Appropriate Asset Allocation
Target date funds ensure that your money is invested in the right mix of assets based on your age and retirement timeline. This means you don’t need to worry about making complex decisions—your investments will be aligned with what’s best for your stage of life. You start with more aggressive growth strategies when you’re younger, and as retirement nears, the fund moves toward preserving the wealth you’ve built.

#### Automatic Rebalancing
One of the major benefits of target date funds is automatic rebalancing. Markets fluctuate, which can cause your investment mix to drift away from its intended allocation. LifePath® takes care of this by regularly rebalancing your portfolio, making sure it stays on track without you needing to lift a finger. This ongoing management helps keep your investments aligned with your goals.

#### Ongoing Risk Management
With a target date fund like LifePath®, risk management is built in. As you near retirement, the fund reduces exposure to more volatile assets, like stocks, and shifts towards safer, more stable investments. This helps protect your savings from sudden market downturns as you get closer to the time when you’ll need them most. Ongoing monitoring and adjustments ensure that your risk level is always appropriate.

#### Low Fees
Another advantage of target date funds is their cost-effectiveness. With low management fees, more of your money stays invested, helping you grow your savings over time. LifePath® is designed to provide a high-quality, professionally managed investment solution at a lower cost than many other options, making it accessible to a wide range of people.

In summary, BlackRock’s LifePath® target date funds offer a smart, hands-off solution for your retirement savings. They automatically manage your investments, adjust risk as you age, and come with low fees—making it easier for you to stay on track for the future you deserve.
