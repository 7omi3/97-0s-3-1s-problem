### How LifePath® Evolves with You: A Strategy for Every Stage of Life

At LifePath®, we understand that your needs change as you move through different stages of your career and approach retirement. That’s why our target date funds are designed to automatically adjust your investment strategy based on your age and your stage in life. Here’s how LifePath® helps you maximize growth when you're young and gradually manage risk as you approach and move through retirement.

#### **Early Career: Maximizing Growth for the Long Run**
When you're just starting your career, your goal is to build wealth over time, so LifePath® focuses heavily on equities. Equities, or stocks, tend to offer higher growth potential, which is crucial when you have **low accumulated savings but high remaining earning potential**. 

By prioritizing investments in **developed and emerging market equities** and **small cap equities**, LifePath® aims to capture the growth opportunities available globally. This focus on growth is ideal for younger investors, as the longer time horizon allows your investments to weather the ups and downs of the market and grow significantly over time.

#### **10 Years to Retirement: Managing Risk While Growing Savings**
As you get closer to retirement, your focus shifts slightly from pure growth to protecting the savings you’ve built. Around 10 years before retirement, LifePath® still invests a large portion in equities to help your money continue to grow, but it also increases exposure to **commodities** and **inflation-linked bonds**. These asset classes help hedge against inflation and market volatility, providing more stability during uncertain economic times.

At this stage, the fund also starts incorporating **government bonds** and a mix of **emerging market debt** and **global corporate bonds** to further manage risk. Since you now have **high accumulated lifetime savings but low remaining earnings potential**, this strategy ensures that while your investments can still grow, there is added protection against market downturns.

#### **Through Retirement: Security and Income for the Long Haul**
Once you enter retirement, the primary goal is to protect your savings and ensure they last throughout your lifetime. At this stage, LifePath® adjusts the portfolio to reduce exposure to equities and shifts toward more stable, income-generating assets. The portfolio becomes more **overweight in bonds**, particularly **government and inflation-linked bonds**, which provide predictable returns with low risk.

With **high accumulated savings and low desired risk**, LifePath® helps you address longevity concerns by focusing on preserving your wealth and creating a steady stream of income. By minimizing volatility, LifePath® ensures you have the financial security to enjoy your retirement without the fear of market fluctuations eroding your savings.
